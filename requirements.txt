Hereâ€™s a `requirements.txt` file for **Drawaria PyMacroRecord** based on the dependencies used in the code:

```plaintext
pynput==1.7.6
tkinter==0.0.0
```

### Explanation:
1. **`pynput`**: Used for capturing and controlling mouse and keyboard inputs.
2. **`tkinter`**: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI). Note that `tkinter` is typically included with Python installations, so it may not need to be installed separately.

### How to Use:
1. Save the above content in a file named `requirements.txt`.
2. Install the dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

This will ensure all necessary libraries are installed for the application to run.
